PART 2

I was unable to log in without a password at home because it kept showing that the password I was typing was wrong even though I have been using it to log in for the past 3 weeks. However, I was able to do this during lab and got logged in without havign to type in a password.



PART 3 
I learnt how to create servers in lab 3 which was really cool since I can now make various different types of servers that can do different things. I have also become much more familiar with github.
